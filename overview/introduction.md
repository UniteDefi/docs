# Introduction

## The Cross-Chain Challenge

The blockchain ecosystem has evolved into a multi-chain world with hundreds of networks, each offering unique features and capabilities. However, this fragmentation creates significant challenges:

- **Liquidity Silos**: Assets are trapped within individual chains
- **Complex Bridging**: Users navigate multiple bridges with varying security models
- **Poor User Experience**: Managing wallets, gas tokens, and bridges across chains
- **Security Risks**: Centralized bridges and wrapped assets introduce vulnerabilities

## Enter Unite DeFi

Unite DeFi is a revolutionary cross-chain protocol that solves these challenges by enabling **trustless, atomic swaps** across 26+ blockchains. Built on 1inch Fusion Extensions, it creates a unified liquidity layer across the entire blockchain ecosystem.

### What Makes Unite DeFi Different?

1. **True Cross-Chain**: Not just EVM-to-EVM, but connecting completely different blockchain architectures
2. **Trustless Design**: No wrapped tokens, no centralized bridges - pure atomic swaps
3. **Universal Support**: From Ethereum to Aptos, from Cosmos to Cardano - all in one protocol
4. **Gasless Experience**: Users don't need native tokens on the source chain
5. **Competitive Pricing**: Dutch auction mechanism ensures best execution prices

## The Vision

Unite DeFi envisions a future where:
- Moving assets between chains is as simple as sending a transaction
- Users aren't limited by chain boundaries when accessing DeFi opportunities
- Liquidity flows freely across the entire blockchain ecosystem
- Cross-chain interactions are secure, fast, and affordable

## Built for ETH Global Unite DeFi 2025

This project showcases what's possible when we unite the fragmented blockchain ecosystem. By integrating with major sponsor chains and leveraging cutting-edge technology like 1inch Fusion Extensions, Unite DeFi demonstrates the future of cross-chain DeFi.

### Key Innovation: Hash Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs)

At the core of Unite DeFi is a sophisticated implementation of HTLCs that works across diverse blockchain architectures:

```
User (Chain A) <-> Relayer <-> Resolver <-> User (Chain B)
```

This creates atomic guarantees - either both legs of the swap complete, or neither does. No trust required.

## Who Benefits?

### Users
- Seamless cross-chain swaps without technical complexity
- Access to liquidity across all supported chains
- No need to hold gas tokens on every chain

### Developers
- Simple API to integrate cross-chain swaps
- Battle-tested infrastructure with 1inch Fusion
- Support for both EVM and non-EVM chains

### Resolvers
- Earn fees by providing cross-chain liquidity
- Automated market-making opportunities
- Fair competition through Dutch auctions

### Blockchain Ecosystems
- Increased liquidity and user accessibility
- Reduced fragmentation
- Enhanced interoperability
